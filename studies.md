## Installation Recommendation

The link provided [Download & Install JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads) will install only the specific Java version. This usually works alright. In a professional environment while working on multiple java projects, different versions may be required. Hence, it is recommended to install java via [sdkman](sdkman.io) or [sdkman for windows](https://medium.com/@gayanper/sdkman-on-windows-661976238042).

At this point of this writing, JDK 17 is the latest LTS. You may download and install the latest LTS (long term support).
